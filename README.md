### Ace-diff

This is an experiment to integrate [Google's diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) 
into Ace Editor. 

The code is an absolute dog's breakfast right now, so don't look too closely. I'm just tinkering around with the big 
pieces to get a sense of how Ace + the diffing lib works, so it'll undergo a giant overhaul once it's complete.
